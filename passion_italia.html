                        I would like to begin this critique with two quotations from Italo Calvino’s Six Memos for the Next Millenium from his chapter on ‘multiplicity’:<br><br>

“Carlo Emilio Gadda tried all his life to represent the world as a knot, a tangled skein of yarn; to represent it without in the least diminishing the inextricable complexity or, to put it better, the simultaneous presence of the most disparate elements that converge to determine every event.” “…as in each episode in one of Gadda’s novels, the least thing is seen as the center of a network of relationships that the writer cannot restrain himself from following, multiplying the details so that his descriptions and digressions become infinite. Whatever the starting point, the matter in hand spreads out and out, encompassing ever vaster horizons, and if it were permitted to go on further and further in every direction, it would end by embracing the entire universe.” <br><br>

I wished to begin this critique with these quotations, at first for it to act as a starting point before embarking on any deeper study, and because these quotations were what I read before I entered the cinema to see Federico Fellini’s 8 1/2 and are in my orbit as I write this critique. I reflected later that there was a distinct connection between Calvino’s elucidations and Federico Fellini’s films, most garishly because they are both Italian and convey a similar fervour that comes off both the page and the screen, and more critically due to a shared commonality on their vision of things, in particular life itself. Furthermore, I found distinct parallels between La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2­ and in recalling the images, their narratives would bleed into one another as though they were somehow inseparable. It is for this reason that I am going to draw my analysis from both films as though they were one.<br><br>

After leaving the cinema, having watched 8 1/2 and having watched La Dolce Vita earlier that week­, it struck me that both films were in one sense about experiencing the ‘mystery of life’ and that Marcello Mastroianni’s characters in both were attempting to unravel it. Mastroianni's characters were not really above or below in society, but were good-looking middle-class men who were in direct contact with chaotic events taking place in everyday life. Marcello (La Dolce Vita) and Guido (8 1/2­) acted like a mirror for the audience, asking us to peer into our own inner being and invoking a necessity for critical reflection. Marcello for example, was taken all over Rome; from a prostitute’s home, to nightclubs, to a castle, he became this sentinel for the audience on a mission to uncover something. But what? This question is never truly answered. His role as a journalist is not without significance as his sensibility was always tweaked with inquisitiveness as his duty was to investigate and report his findings (to the audience). In the film we see him surmount perhaps his greatest challenge: reporting on the spectacle of his own life. Curiously, La Dolce Vita could in fact spread out and out, expanding in either direction, for example, including Marcello’s early childhood or his old age. This is maybe where 8 1/2­ ties in, where Guido’s early memories as a boy (taunting the gypsy Saraghina to dance, his punitive experiences at church) and his experiences of his later life (such as the dream sequences depicting the distant relationship with his father and the harem of the women he met during his life), are continuations in each direction, or even better, fragments that are a part of the ‘collective narrative’ of La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2­. If Fellini’s narrative was “permitted to go on further and further” I have no doubt that it would indeed end up “embracing the entire universe.”<br><br>

Both films could be described as a “tangled skein of yarn”, or more precisely, a tangled skein of ‘tête-à-têtes’; some appearing to be of solemn importance while others mere sweet nothings, idle musings, or flirtatious banter. Here, there are clear parallels to Calvino’s observations on Gadda’s work, in that Fellini was able to make even the least significant conversation appear to be at the centre of a “network of relationships” where Mastroianni’s characters were again like a mirror or a sentinel, but in a very human way as they attempted to navigate a myriad of personal relationships. Notable examples include: his troubled relationship with the church and religion, his distant relationship with his father (in both films), the apparent judgement from others of his wife Emma (in La Dolce Vita), his wife’s suspicion of his infidelity, his relationship with his own psyche and neurosis, and so on. Each conversation exposed these relationships, and more broadly, were always in service of something greater, this ‘other’ that could be felt as being the mystery of life.<br><br>

In the final scene of La Dolce Vita, Marcello sees a young girl across a small body of water while he was by the ocean, a girl that he in fact had come across on his travels earlier in the film. Out of earshot and failing to communicate through speaking she makes gestures with her hands to say that she knows him. And yet Marcello puts his hands up in confusion and frowns as if to say ‘I don’t understand? What are you trying to say?’ After a few attempts, she gives up and she smiles, with the hope of him remembering her lost, then turns her head and looks directly into the camera and the screen fades to black. With this simple look, she seems to bring the audience physically into the film,? but it is hard to pinpoint what exactly she is trying to do. In one sense she is showing us that she sees us, and she is inviting us in, inviting the world into the film. In many ways the film was like watching life-in-motion, and the girl's look brings the world in creating an eternal connection between the outside world and the film. Marcello’s miscommunication appears now to be something more symbolic, as though he was saying, with a quick offhandness ‘I don't understand...what is this? What is all of this? This thing called life?’ In keeping with this theme, the final sequence in 8 1/2­ where Guido, depicted here as a small boy, leads a marching band at twilight, was Fellini’s way of saying that we are all children, marching to the beat of life’s music, into the night, for all eternity.<br><br>

Most mysterious was both Marcello and Guido’s relationship with women, and the roles they played in their lives. Maddalena, Marcellos’s first romantic encounter in La Dolce Vita, was a lover and could be nothing more. His wife Emma, embodied a more maternal love, seen feeding him, worrying about him, and calling him incessantly – her love for him was unconditional and true. And Slyvia, with such beauty and charm was the epitome of every man’s desires, and for Marcello an untouchable idol of sex and desire, an incarnation of Venus herself. These roles were reprised in 8 1/2­: Carla his boisterous lover, Luisa his stable, maternal wife, and Claudia, the woman of his dreams. Both Marcello and Guido were womanisers, and their treatment of women was at times unfair where infidelity was an accepted norm. However, there remained an undue respect, and at times even a worship towards women. This was no more apparent than when Guido “finally gets his harem” in 8 1/2­. One could view both Marcello and Guido as unlikeable characters, and yet with all their flaws, they were perhaps more emblematic of how a person acts in the face of a burning desire.<br><br>

Both films show that the film medium – so often today associated as a medium for the masses, as ‘entertainment’ – is capable of provoking deep intellectual thought. I found both films reminiscent of Andrei Tarkovsky’s films, in particular Andrei Rublev and Stalker. One could even go as far as saying that La Dolce Vita was Tarkovsky’s Andrei Rublev, with its depiction of the joys and horrors of life, and 8 1/2­ Tarkovsky’s Stalker, for its story about dreams and memories and for all its surrealism. These films were from a distinct era, with a tangible quality of free-spiritedness, truly in touch with the human condition. The sheer mass of people in certain frames, who moved in such a raw, unchoreographed way, and the actors who acted with such freedom and better still a palpable exactitude, it was as though it were life itself.<br><br>

I have attempted to thread a line through La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2­ and perhaps have only just begun an endless journey of analysis. Carlo Emilio Gadda and Italo Calvino for that matter, would have much to say about these films and perhaps I have provided them with their starting point from which they could continue to digress into the infinite. La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2­ are Fellini’s masterpieces, and will be forever cherished as a part of the history of cinema for, if anything, their sheer scale as towering depictions of life and all its mystery.
