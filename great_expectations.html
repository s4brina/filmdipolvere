                        Wong kar-wai this, Wong kar-wai that. I’ve heard so much about the films by this famous director, yet have never seen any. Tonight, I am going to see his film Fallen Angels which is set in Hong Kong and Hong Kong was where I was born. Hong Kong holds a dear place in my heart even if I don’t remember much of it. I was only 3 when we left to go live in America. I don't have fully formed memories or any memories that I can recall. My memories seem to be pieced together through photographs my dad took when we lived there, and that’s where my memories end. Perhaps there are latent memories, enmeshed in my subconscious somewhere and perhaps this is where Wong kar-wai's film Fallen Angels comes in, to trigger these latent memories. Will the buildings trigger something in me? The atmosphere? The characters? <br><br>

                        Aside: I’ve been trying to draw some art and have had little success. The entire time I was thinking ‘this is going to be a work of art I can give to my friend Trent’ and I put this pressure on myself to produce something that Trent would "like”. It was as though the final outcome had to achieve a certain standard or look a certain way for it to be any good. And going into each drawing with the premise that 'this piece must be a great work of art', was so inhibiting. There was no state of flow, no release, no catharsis. Not that that always happens, but I’ve found that when we let go and are just ‘in it’, we seem to produce great work. There was nothing like that when I was drawing, and I think it had something to do with the pressure and importance I placed on the work which was lurking in the background. Ultimately it was inhibiting my ability to ‘play’.<br><br>

                        I’m writing this because just now I watched this short 30 second clip on Rick Rubin’s Instagram where he said something like ‘the best ideas come most often and most easily when we are in this relaxed state. If we put pressure on a piece of art too early we instinctually become more cautious and restrain ourselves.’ I think that is exactly what was happening me earlier today. To return to Fallen Angels (and my expectations as I’ve written above), I am putting a lot of pressure on the film to deliver. I have in mind that it will be this masterful work of art that will change my life. Being open to art requires you to be vulnerable and it is by no means easy to allow art to affect you. But I don’t think that is what I’m getting at. What I’m trying to say is that, although I am open to letting Fallen Angels affect me and am going in openly with that conviction, I have this vision of what the film will turn out to be. This vision has been pieced together by positive feedback from friends and people I’ve met, from clips of the film I’ve seen online, it's mysticism as a ‘classic’ of Hong Kong cinema. With all of this circling in my mind before I even step foot into the movie theatre, there is a lot of pressure on the film to deliver. Not just deliver, but to change my life. That is a great expectation and one which only resigns the film to failure. With this expectation, you no longer possess openness towards the work of art, but rather become closed-off. You are no longer pliable, but rather rigid and hard. There is no vulnerability, you are determined to see the film in a particular light. You have made up your mind and nothing will stand in the way. This does not bode well for allowing the film to affect you let alone allow you to enjoy it. Perhaps it is when you least expect art is when it affects you the most.

                        Anyway, about to head out to see Fallen Angels. I’ll be back to write what I thought about it and if the above has anything to do with it.  
                        <br><br>
                        I’ve come back from the film and there’s a few things I’d like to say. First off, I’m bitterly disappointed. Perhaps this is no surprise after what I have written above. As I said, with great expectations it was doomed to fail. But does my disappointment have everything to do with this expectation, or were there other things at play? 
                        <br><br>
                        Stylistically, Fallen Angels is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. The close-up shots, the weird dutch angels, the fisheye lens, it was surreal at times. However, what bugged me was that the film itself seemed to be self-aware of it’s avant-garde approach that it almost became pretentious. That is a criticism that no artist would like to hear, but it is the truth. There was little to no story, and the unreality of the characters created this disconnect which eventually grew into impatience and ultimately a kind of nausea (maybe that was just the dizzying camera movements that never seemed to be more than 2 feet away from someone’s face.) This unreality or suspension of belief was broken many times by the forceful acting of the actors that it neither sat in the fiction camp, nor the docufiction camp, it somehow managed to occupy this uncanny valley of what I can only describe as people-trying-to-act-ordinary-but-not-too-ordinary with lives that are ordinary-but-not-too-ordinary in ordinary Hong Kong (but not the super ordinary, the ‘cool’ ordinary). Basically, the film never settled on whether it wanted to tell the truth about life in Hong Kong or give us the romanticised version. It honestly seemed to occupy this middle-ground that on most occasions I find appealing, yet in Fallen Angels it only became more off-putting.
                        <br><br>

                        The camerawork of the film was what kept me intrigued and I genuinely looked forward to what interesting composition would arise next. The aesthetics of the film are perhaps why it is so revered and so loved by many. Fallen Angels is a true aesthetic experience and unfortunately, I’m so over aesthetic experiences. I don’t know if this has anything to do with the fact that since watching the Sadie brother’s film Heaven Knows What, I have become more aware of my taste for realism, but I have always disliked films that looked pretty but never had substance. Past examples of films like this are The Tree of Life by Terrence Malik, Only God Forgives by Nicolas Winding Refn, On the Silver Globe by Andrzej Zulawski, Hard to Be A God by Aleksei Yuryevich German, and The Holy Mountain by Alejandro Jodorowsky (which I only watched 30 minutes). All of these films were stylistically some of the greatest works in the history of cinema. So, what was lacking? Concreteness, substance, story. As much as cinema can be art (and in many ways remains a medium for art) there needs to be, for me at least, something deeper than aesthetics. Aesthetics will only go so far. A work of art that looks amateur yet carries weight is far more appealing to me than a work of art that looks masterful yet feels paper-thin.
                        <br><br>
                        I expected great things from Fallen Angels, and left half-full. Aesthetically satisfying, soulfully wanting, it never seemed to connect with me, and once a film or a novel or a work of art doesn’t grab you immediately, it is a hard road for it to come round. 3 out of 5. 
                        <br><br>
                        Postscript:
                        <br><br>
                        This has gotten me thinking about aesthetics in films and I wonder whether aesthetics are even a concern for some directors? I think many mainstream directors care more about story, and aesthetics are sort of a by-product. I’ve never read Finnegan’s Wake, but was Joyce only concerned about aesthetics in that novel? I’ve flicked through it and it makes absolutely no sense. I know there may be more to it but I just don’t understand it. Maybe I’m missing something? Are aesthetics even separate from storytelling? Is it baked into the story itself? So far I’ve been describing aesthetics, at least in film, as a separate entity, a kind of “film” or “coating” that is sort of vacuum-sealed over the story, as though aesthetics are the film’s facade and the story it’s bricks and mortar. Am I on the right track here?
                        <br><br>
                        I just read a bit of criticism of Finnegan’s Wake. It seems like nobody really understood it at the time, and many people do not understand it even today. I am all for experimentation, as long as it at least reaches back to reality. David Lynch is a master at this and his films are at times utterly absurd and abstract, yet deep with meaning. Many films I’ve seen that are ‘experimental’ care more for the fact of their experimentation than communicating anything intelligible to the average human. These works I feel are critically ‘unrelatable’.
                        <br><br>
                        Again, I am all for experimentation and trying things out, but not every idea is a good idea, and to put out every idea into the world and frame it as some kind of ‘experiment’ without any deeper thought, self-criticism or analysis, creates follies not foundations. There must be some aspect of curation or refinement to art, and I find that many people just put up/out whatever new thing they’ve come up with online without any sort of deeper thought other than to seek validation or seek exposure or even as a way of saying “I’m still here”. The democratisation of marketing artwork, particularly through Instagram, has allowed anyone, literally anyone, to put their work out and draw in an audience. But that in turn has flooded the ‘market’ with so much content that there now appears to be a sea of mediocrity. Am I a part of this mediocrity? Am I just putting out my content and framing them as ‘criticism’? Is any of this criticism ‘good’? Hard to say, but I’ll keep writing anyway.
