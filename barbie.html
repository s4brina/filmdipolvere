                    <p class="article"> Barbie. A household name known around the world has come to represent what young women could aspire to be. While the doll Barbie
                        couldn't speak, film Barbie could, and it had a lot to say (and poke fun at) regarding
                        female empowerment, feminism and womanhood. Yet that is not what I would like to focus on here.
                        I saw a parallel message to the one targeted at young women which has to do with Ken's
                        journey, and his struggle for identity.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Barbie shows us how easily young men fall into performing “man”. Judith Butler notes “gender is
                        a kind of doing” and there is a current version of masculinity that young men are doing that has
                        become colloquially known as “toxic masculinity”. This "toxic" version of masculinity isn't new
                     and is well-documented in films and TV shows (think Rocky Balboa, Cool Hand Luke, Mad Men). Elisabeth Krimer
                        notes that all of the essays in "Subverting Masculinity" (published in 2000) show that
                        "masculinity emerges as a concept under siege", and in 2023, this siege is well underway. The societal pressures for men to perform "man" has slowly disintegrated and new norms are becoming more mainstream.Butler and Krimer both agree that society provides "norms", and these norms provide coercive criteria which
                        govern ideals of what constitutes a "real" man or a "real" woman. (Butler, 1990; Krimer, 2000).
                        So who are the people that decide what this norm looks and sounds like? Russell West in "Subverting Masculinity" notes that
                        "film's combination of visual, textual, and performance discourses" make it "such a potent
                        encoding of gender patterns." Today "film" could largely been seen as films on social media. And who is the face of masculine, male performance on social media? Andrew Tate. And
                        Barbie says there is a danger in that. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        Andrew Tate is in every sense (rhetoric, internet-phenomena, pop-culture) Barbie's antithesis. He is global personality who was once the most Googled man on Earth and has built a
                        large following, specifically from young men, and his reach should not be underestimated. Tate’s
                        message is manifold, but critically argues for “masculine excellence” and the reprising of
                        “traditional masculinity”. Tate offers men guidance to become a certain image of "man":
                        “strong, charismatic, wealthy”. He tells men not to submit to the “enslavement” of feminists who
                        are trying to “cut your balls off” and instil “cowardice”, and his extreme performance of
                        masculinity (loud, arrogant, aggressive) and how he “doesn’t easily bend a knee” (Peterson,
                        2023), is in itself his message. Ken's journey from Barbieland, to the real world, into Kendom
                        foreshadows how easily young men are corrupted by trend-setters like Andrew Tate which offer them reclamation of their manhood. When Ken (and the other Kens) begin behaving
                        like Andrew Tate, they become monsters. They impose their power over the Barbies, treat
                        them as servants, as second-rate, and as sex objects. They behave in a way that suggests they have contempt for the Barbies and by extension
                        women. What is most worrying is that these Andrew Tateisms are no longer just on the periphery, but have slowly moved more and more into the mainstream. Barbie is a film of the moment, and it is saying that in this moment young men are looking up to the wrong man. Who or what is the alternative?
                        <br><br><br>
                        Ken. Ken's journey out of Kendom and back to Barbieland shows us that it is possible to break free from the societal pressures
                        and to reevaluate traditional norms of masculinity. Ken realises he was being disingenuous to himself when he was trying to act “cool” and be the “tough guy”. Instead, he saw
                        that he should be the “warm” man (to borrow a phrase from the School of Life): sensitive,
                        vulnerable, and caring. The dance sequence towards the end of the film displays this struggle to
                        decide between being the “cool” disingenuous man or the “warm” genuine man. Ken opts for the
                        latter, and realises he doesn't have to be like anyone. He can just be Ken.
                        <br><br><br>
                        This internal struggle between being part of "the boys" or just being "you" is something that
                        many adolescent boys face growing up (think of Jonah Hill's film 'Mid90s'). Barbie was a
                        cultural "event" and I can imagine many girlfriends dragging their boyfriends along, or sisters
                        going to see it with their brothers, fathers and their daughters. Barbie
                        took the chance to say something loud and clear to this younger generation: the mysogyny, sexual
                        abuse, harrassment, domestic violence, and contempt for women, all associated with this
                        brand of toxic masculinity, must end. Ken shows men there is an alternative. Barbie killed
                        Andrew Tateisms dead in the water. But would everyone see it this way?
                        <br><br><br>
                        There is a very easy temptation to walk out of the film and think that the message was: “all men
                        are evil”. At one point, I succumbed to the films negative portrayal of men and even felt a
                        little disarmed. Writing now, I find it hard to discuss some issues in the film because I am a
                        man, and because I’m a man, I am not in the position to talk about certain issues, specifically ones that relate to
                        women. In saying this, I would like to stress the fact that we don’t live in a vacuum. It is an open
                        dialogue: a woman issue is a man issue and vice versa. The dissolution of any contructive
                        dialogue only widens inequality, not close it up. The conclusion that Barbie was merely
                        preaching “women are good, men are evil” would be a great TikTok edit. If you dig a little deeper past this first superficial layer, you discover that Barbie, who represents women, in the end lives in a harmonious and respectful society in relation to Ken, who represents men, and both men and women benefit as a result.
                        <br><br><br>
                        Perhaps a film like Barbie was the only way a message like this could be delivered. What about a
                        ground-breaking novel? Sure, but it wouldn’t have had the same engagement, particularly with a
                        younger audience, and nowhere near to the same scale. Again, placing the film in context of
                        social media (#Barbenheimer) Barbie is seismic. A middle-of-the-road film that talked about the
                        same issues, a film like “Little Women” (which Gerwig also directed), wouldn’t have had the same
                        impact. It wouldn’t have been such a cultural “event”. But most importantly, it wouldn’t have
                        drawn in the sheer number and diversity of crowds into the cinema. 
                        <br><br><br>
                        My fear is that young men will take this film the wrong way and blanket hate against it and am
                        afraid that this is likely an inevitability. Yet I hope there are some that will dig just a
                        little deeper, because for all of its gloss and glamour, there
                        is something deeper to Barbieland. Barbie was a film of the moment and I wonder whether we will
                        see any real change after its message has sunk in... or whether it will be just another social
                        media post that we double-tap, scroll past, and forget.
