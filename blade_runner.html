                        <br><br><br>“All those moments will be lost, like tears in rain”- Roy Batty
                        <br><br><br>

                        There is no greater merging of music, voice and image than when that line is spoken in Blade Runner. It is a ‘one-liner’, and a one-liner is romantic. It has always been associated with romance in films, or is at least a highly romanticised cliche of cinema. Blade Runner is romantic. The score, the one-liners, the intimate, downbeat noir aesthetic. We desire to partake in it’s romance because it is something we long for, like we long for a lover. As the viewer you are suddenly triangulated between the film and Eros, and Eros is lack. In her essay “Eros the Bittersweet”, Anne Carson explains that this perception of lack derives from the metaphorical hole that is within us, and is a hole we crave to be filled. When we watch Blade Runner, we are struck by a world which suddenly fills that hole. A feeling overcomes us and makes our heart soar. What is this feeling?
                        <br><br>
                        You could say it is something like the feeling of nostalgia. Nostalgia for another time. Which time? A fictional time. One that exists only onscreen. Yet you desire to return to it. You attempt to reach across the void and grasp it, to be part of its romance. Yet you never quite get a hold of it. Just as desire sets in, the movie ends, and there immediately begins your longing for it once more. Why?
                        <br><br>

                        Cinema of today is so clean and crisp. Although these larger-than-life worlds are rich in detail, you fail to connect with them. They are spectacular, but that is all they remain: a spectacle. You are never truly in contact with the world because it remains untouchable, always at arms length, out of reach. Yet in Blade Runner, Los Angeles is rainy, it's dirty, it's gritty. You can almost smell it. It has character, personality, and charm, as opposed to being sterile, cold, or soulless. These words are so often associated with neighbourhoods of culture that have undergone gentrification, which brings me to my next point. Blade Runner has been gentrified. How?
                        <br><br>

                        Here is now apt to place the old Blade Runner in its context, alongside its newer sequel, Blade Runner 2049. 2049 is the gentrified version of the original. It only signals at what made the original so magical, so beautiful and so romantic. It is a cultivated, cleaner, and more commercialised version. Much of this aesthetic correlates with the artistic direction afforded by the film’s budget, and 2049 was a "big-budget" film. It is beautifully shot, and Roger Deakin’s cinematography is a work of art in many respects. And I’m not saying this gentrified version is necessarily a bad thing. Occasional upheaval can bring renewed spirit. However, something is almost certainly lost in the process. And between the original and 2049, there is something that 2049 does not do which the original does: ensnare you in the irresistible web of Eros. 2049 is something to behold. The original is something you could hold. Why does that matter?
                        <br><br>

                        Well it comes back to the point about encountering Eros and reaching across the void to grasp the desired or beloved. There is something about the original in how it presented itself that makes it immensely more tangible compared to 2049. The original appears almost like a papier-mâché model. It is rough around the edges, but you see beauty in its crags and crevices. But most importantly you see the human hand by which it was made. On the other hand, 2049 is carved with a laser. It is clinical, clean, crisp, chiseled out with robotic precision. It is aesthetically more refined. More a Greek statue to behold as opposed to a papier-mâché model you can touch and feel. The original is the human. 2049 is the replicant.
                        <br><br>

                        To return to where we started, with Roy Batty’s famous last words, we come to the subtle and delicate tones of the music that accompany Roy's final utterance. Vangelis’ score is so empathetic to the human condition that it carries you along when it swells to the highest highs of the cosmos, down to the Earth and to earthly things, like falling in love. 2049’s score is the exact opposite. Raucous, distressing, harsh, angular. It is of a replicants hand, and not one who is empathetic towards humanity.
                        <br><br>

                        Blade Runner is a masterpiece. It strikes us at our core desire for desire. We partake in it’s romance because it fills the metaphorical hole within us, a hole which we didn’t realise was there until we watch the film and are struck by Eros. We can never live in that world. But at the very least, we can watch Deckard and Rachel encounter each other, and perhaps through them we are able to enjoy the experience of being triangulated between ourselves, Eros, and the world of Blade Runner.
