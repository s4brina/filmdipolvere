                        <br><br><br>“All those moments will be lost, like tears in rain”- Roy Batty
                        <br><br><br>

                        There is no greater merging of music, voice and image than when that line is spoken in Blade
                        Runner (1982). It is a ‘one-liner’, and a one-liner is romantic. It has always been associated
                        with romance in films, or is at least a highly romanticised cliche of cinema. Blade Runner is
                        romantic. The score, the one-liners, the “intimate, downbeat noir” aesthetic. (Bradshaw, 2017)
                        We desire to partake in this romantic world. And we also long for it, like we long for a lover.
                        As the viewer you are suddenly triangulated between the film and Eros, and Eros is lack.
                        (Carson, 1986) You find in Blade Runner that which our world lacks. An indescribable feeling
                        overcomes you and makes your heart soar in finding this. What is this feeling?<br><br>

                        You could say it is something like the feeling of nostalgia for another time. Which time? A
                        fictional time. One that exists only onscreen. Yet you desire to return to it. You attempt to
                        reach across and grasp it and be part of its romantic world. Yet you never quite get a hold of
                        it, and then the movie ends. You wish this feeling could continue, forever if possible. It is
                        difficult to surmise this feeling in words, and "nostalgia" doesn't seem to tell the whole
                        story. Yet this feeling lingers. Why?<br><br>

                        Cinema of today is so clean, crisp and Ultra4K. Everything is laser projected. At times you feel
                        like you are in an operating theatre. Although these larger-than-life worlds are rich in detail,
                        you fail to connect with them. They are spectacular, but that is all they remain: a spectacle.
                        You are never really in contact with the world because it remains untouchable, always at arms
                        length, out of reach. Yet in Blade Runner, 2019 Los Angeles is rainy, it's dirty, it's gritty,
                        things look dilapidated. You can almost smell it. Your senses are engaged. It has character,
                        personality, charm, as opposed to being sterile, cold, or soulless. These words are so often
                        associated with neighbourhoods of culture in our cities, which brings me to my next point. What
                        is happening in cinema today is gentrification. How?<br><br>

                        It is the same with what is happening in our cities. Cultural precints that were once vibrant
                        cultural hubs for the arts and its community are now populated with cultivated, curated
                        establishments for the wealthy. You only have to look at what is happening in Dublin, which my
                        friend Felix McNamara has observed that since the 1980s the city has "transformed from one of
                        the least expensive eurozone capitals to one of the most expensive.” (McNamara, 2023) Here is
                        now apt to place the old Blade Runner in context with its newer sequel, Blade Runner 2049.
                        <br><br>

                        2049 is the gentrified version of the original. It only signals at what was so magical, so
                        beautiful, so romantic about the original. It is a more cultivated, more curated, more
                        commercialised version. Much of this aesthetic correlates with the artistic direction with
                        regards to budget, and 2049 was a "big-budget" film. It is beautifully shot, a work of art in
                        many respects and this gentrified version is not necessarily a bad thing. Occasional upheveal
                        can bring renewed spirit. However, something is almost certainly lost in the process. And
                        between the original and 2049, there is something that the latter does not do which the former
                        does: consume you with a feeling of nostalgia, or ensnare you in the web of Eros. 2049 is
                        something to behold. The original is something the you could actually potentially hold. Why does
                        that matter? <br><br>

                        Well it comes back to the point about encountering Eros and reaching across to grasp the desired
                        or "beloved" (Carson, 1986) There is something about the original in how it presented itself
                        that makes it more tangible compared to 2049. It appears like a papier-mâché model. Speculating,
                        you could imagine there were bits of goop falling off and that they were just wanting to get the
                        damn thing to dry. Finally, the model is rough around the edges, but you see beauty in its crags
                        and crevices, and most importantly you see the human hand by which it was made. On the other
                        hand, 2049 is carved with a laser. It is clinical, clean, crisp, chiseled out with robotic
                        precision. It is aesthetically more refined. More a Greek statue to behold than a papier-mâché
                        model with which you can touch and feel. The original is the human. 2049 is the replicant.
                        <br><br>

                        To return to where we started, with Roy Batty’s famous last words, we also come to the subtle
                        and delicate tones of the music that accompany Roy's final utterance, tones which point to Roy’s
                        sympathy with humanity. Empathy I think they call it. And it is Vangelis’ score that is so
                        empathetic to the human condition that it carries you along when it swells to the highest highs
                        of the cosmos, down to the Earth and to earthly things, like falling in love. 2049's score is
                        its exact opposite. Raucous, distressing, harsh, angular (Bradshaw, 2017). It is of a replicants
                        hand, and not one who is empathetic towards humanity. <br><br>

                        Perhaps I am saying this because Blade Runner is my favourite movie. Call me a romantic. Call me
                        nostalgic. I don’t mind. Blade Runner is a masterstroke of the human hand, and at least will
                        remain an artefact of great handmade cinema. We are lucky it cannot be erased. Yet that
                        is.<br><br><br>
