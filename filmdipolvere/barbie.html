                    <p class="article"> Barbie. A symbol for the aspirations of young women. While the doll Barbie
                        couldn't speak, film Barbie could, and it had a lot to say (and poke fun at) with regards to
                        female empowerment, feminism and womanhood. Yet that is not what I would like to focus on here.
                        As a man, I saw a parallel message to the one targeted at young women. It has to do with Ken's
                        journey, and his struggle for identity.<br><br><br>

                        Barbie shows us how easily young men fall into performing “man”. Judith Butler notes “gender is
                        a kind of doing” and there is a current version of masculinity that young men are doing that has
                        become colloquially known as “toxic masculinity”. This "toxic" version of masculinity isn't new
                        and a figure like Andrew Tate could be seen as its most contemporary proponent. Elisabeth Krimer
                        notes that all of the essays in "Subverting Masculinity" (published in 2000) show that
                        "masculinity emerges as a concept under siege". In 2023 this siege has fully matured and a
                        personality like Andrew Tate could be seen as the most visual last stand for "masculinity".
                        Andrew Tate is in every sense (rhetoric, internet-phenomena, pop-culture) Barbie's antithesis -
                        he stands for "traditional" masculinity and how to be a "man". Barbie on the other hand, stands
                        for the dismantlement of an oppressive patriarchy and more broadly asks us to reevaluate this
                        outdated form of "traditional" (or "toxic") maculinity that has continued to grow online. Is
                        "traditional" masculinity even a relevant concept today? Or is it a concept that remains on the
                        periphery and is slowly being phased out? And are the views presented in Barbie radical, or
                        reasonable in light of toxic masculinity phenomena like Andrew Tate?<br><br><br>

                        First off, I believe this concept of "traditional" masculinity is as vital as ever. Butler and
                        Krimer both agree that society provides "norms", and these norms provide coercive criteria which
                        govern ideals of what constitutes a "real" man or a "real" woman. (Butler, 1990; Krimer, 2000).
                        So who are the people that decide what this norm looks and sounds like? Russell West notes that
                        "film's combination of visual, textual, and performance discourses" make it "such a potent
                        encoding of gender patterns." Today "film" (movies) has largely been replaced by social media
                        "films". And who is the face of masculine, male performance on social media? Andrew Tate. And
                        Barbie says there is a danger in that. <br><br><br>

                        Andrew Tate is global personality who was once the most Googled man on Earth. He has built a
                        large following, specifically from young men, and his reach should not be underestimated. Tate’s
                        message is manifold, but critically argues for “masculine excellence” and the reprising of
                        “traditional masculinity”. Tate offers men "guidance" to become a certain image of "man":
                        “strong, charismatic, wealthy”. He tells men not to submit to the “enslavement” of feminists who
                        are trying to “cut your balls off” and instil “cowardice”, and his extreme performance of
                        masculinity (loud, arrogant, aggressive) and how he “doesn’t easily bend a knee” (Peterson,
                        2023), is in itself his message. Ken's journey from Barbieland, to the real world, into Kendom
                        foreshadows the growing trend of Andrew Tateism. When Ken (and the other Kens) begin behaving
                        like Andrew Tate, they become like monsters. They impose their power over the Barbies, treat
                        them as second-citizens, and as sex objects. More critically they have a general contempt for
                        women. Barbie is a film of the moment, and it is saying that in this moment young men are
                        looking up to the wrong "man". Who or what is the alternative?
                        Ken is. And Ken's journey shows us that it is possible to break free from the societal pressures
                        placed on men to act "manly" and be "masculine". Ken realises he was being disingenuous and
                        never truly himself when he was trying to act “cool” and be the “tough guy”. Instead, he saw
                        that he should be the “warm” man (to borrow a phrase from the School of Life): sensitive,
                        vulnerable, and caring. The dance sequence towards the end of the film displays his struggle to
                        decide between being the “cool”, disingenuous man or the “warm”, genuine man. Ken opts for the
                        latter, and realises he doesn't have to be like anyone. He can just be Ken. <br><br><br>

                        This internal struggle between being part of "the boys" or just being "you" is something that
                        many adolescent boys face growing up (think of Jonah Hill's film 'Mid90s'). Barbie was a
                        cultural "event" and I can imagine many girlfriends dragging their boyfriends along, or sisters
                        going to see it with their brothers, fathers and their daughters, mums and their sons. Barbie
                        took the chance to say something directly to this younger generation: that the mysogyny, sexual
                        abuse, harrassment, domestic violence, and overall contempt for women all associated with this
                        brand of "toxic masculinity" must end. Ken shows us there is an alternative. Barbie killed
                        Andrew Tateisms dead in the water. But would everyone see it this way? <br><br><br>

                        There is a very easy temptation to walk out of the film and think that the message was: “all men
                        are evil”. At one point, I succumbed to the films negative portrayal of men and even felt a
                        little disarmed. Writing now, I find it hard to discuss some issues in the film because I am a
                        man, and because I’m a man, I have no right or place to be talking about issues that relate to
                        women. However, I would like to stress the fact that we don’t live in a vacuum. It is an open
                        dialogue: a woman issue is a man issue and vice versa. The dissolution of any contructive
                        dialogue only widens gender inequality, not close it up. The conclusion that Barbie was merely
                        preaching “women are good, men are evil” would be a great TikTok edit. Yet I saw something
                        deeper. If you look past this first superficial layer, you discover there are more layers to
                        this pop-art-painting. Barbie was a portrait of women living in a potential future where men
                        critically performed like good and proper humans, and women benefitted as a result. <br><br><br>

                        Perhaps a film like Barbie was the only way a message like this could be delivered. What about a
                        ground-breaking novel? Sure, but it wouldn’t have had the same engagement, particularly with a
                        younger audience, and nowhere near to the same scale. Again, placing the film in context of
                        social media (#Barbenheimer) Barbie is seismic. A middle-of-the-road film that talked about the
                        same issues, a film like “Little Women” (which Gerwig also directed), wouldn’t have had the same
                        impact. It wouldn’t have been such a cultural “event”. But most importantly, it wouldn’t have
                        drawn in the sheer number and diversity of crowds into the cinema. The fanaticism surrounding
                        this movie was something I hadn't seen since the 7th Star Wars. Even then this is completely
                        different. <br><br><br>

                        My fear is that young men will take this film the wrong way and blanket hate against it and am
                        afraid that this is likely an inevitability. Yet I hope there are some that will dig just a
                        little deeper into this “dense” pop-cult-film, because for all of its gloss and glamour, there
                        is something deeper to Barbieland. Barbie was a film of the moment and I wonder whether we will
                        see any real change after its message has sunk in... or whether it will be just another social
                        media post that we double-tap, scroll past, and forget.
