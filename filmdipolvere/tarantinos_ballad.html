                        Quentin Tarantino’s 9th film, Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood, is a jam-packed epic. Set towards the end of the Golden Age of Hollywood in 1969, this was a film for film-lovers with each scene a tightly choreographed sequence that conveyed not only Tarantino’s vast knowledge of film but his eye for great cinema and his love of movies. Everything from the hokey, fictional TV shows Bounty Law and FBI (shot in the old Academy ratio) to the hand-painted movie posters, the film was oozing with nostalgia for Old Hollywood. In doing so, the film certainly tugged at the heartstrings, especially when a corny one-liner was said. Like when Rick Dalton (Leonardo Di Caprio) in The 14 Fists of McCluskey says “Did anybody order fried sauerkraut!?” after torching a group of Nazis with his flamethrower, or when Tex Watson (Austin Butler) says “I’m as real as a doughnut motherfucker.” The movie was full of these wonderful one-liners which, it has to be said, is business as usual for Tarantino.<br><br>

The structure of the film could be seen as a series of 'vignettes', each with their own distinct character, mis-en-scene, and function, yet strung together in seamless fashion. For example, the film opens with a sequence of scenes with Rick Dalton in action, killing outlaws in Bounty Law. Rick and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) are then interviewed by a TV host who has a bright, mid-Atlantic, radio voice, so often associated with that era. This interview was shot in black and white and in the old Academy format. Cut to a few scenes later, Rick has just been told by Marvin Shwarz (Al Pacino) his career is heading down the drain if he continues playing the role of the ‘heavy’ (the bad guy). He’s out in the carpark and is telling Cliff he must go to Rome to act in these “goddamn I-talian movies” and that he’s a “has-been”. He sucks on his cigarette desperately and begins to cry, with Cliff consoling him with a brotherly pat and words of support. These scenes were shot in colour and a widescreen format. Through these opening scenes, you see the duality of the ‘actor’ and the ‘human’. You begin to take notice of the actual actor’s performance, as in the aforementioned scenes, the acting of Leonardo Di Caprio and Brad Pitt. This is an observation that is always in the background when viewing a film, at times noticeable and at others transparent, yet Tarantino sets a premise - he wants you to take notice of the actor’s work. <br><br>

Another one of these ‘vignettes’ showcasing the actor's craft, was the scene in the saloon with Rick Dalton and James Stacy (Timothy Olyphant). First of all, the scene was so rich in it’s cinematography; the bar lit in this cool, direct sunlight, the swirling smoke from Rick’s exhale of a cigarette, the collection of crumbs and left-over nuts strewn across the bar. Everything about it was pure cinema. After they take a shot of Mescal, they sit on a table by the bar and begin discussing something about the Lancer family. The camera then pans around James’ head to face Rick, who then fluffs his lines. He asks to do a retake and they continue. Rick, a few lines later, forgets his lines again, apologises to the director, yells at himself, then psyches himself up saying “You’re Rick fucking Dalton.”  Following this scene, Rick bursts into his trailer, throws whatever objects he can get his hands on at the wall, and yells at himself for looking like he didn’t rehearse, when in fact he rehearsed a lot. He then looks into a mirror on the wall, and looking straight down the camera he says “If you forget your lines again, I’m gonna blow your motherfucking brains out”, as if he is speaking directly to the audience. You feel the pressure he is under, you feel the pressure of the actor, and you come to appreciate the craft of the actor. Tarantino showcases the actor as more than just the character onscreen, but as a human-being. This was no more evident than in the aftermath of the kidnapping scene with Rick, Trudi Frazer (Julia Butters) and Wayne Maunder (Luke Perry) where Trudi walks up to Rick and whispers in his ear "that was the best acting that I have ever seen in my life", to which Rick says thank you, and later says to himself "You're Rick fucking Dalton."<br><br>

Tarantino’s hand is all over this film, from the editing to the cinematography, and of course the script and dialogue. One scene that I had never seen before, and would struggle to find a comparison to, was when Cliff leaves Rick’s house, walks to his car, backs out, does a 180, and drives off. This sequence was all shot from the roof of Rick’s house and was from a perspective I had never seen before. It was a really cool shot, and something for the film-lover to indulge in. This metacognitive idea of ‘feeling’ the director behind the scenes was also evident in Rick’s first meeting with James Stacy. James is seen talking to Rick, then all of a sudden, it cuts to another segment of their conversation, then cuts again with James' hat dropping onto his head. Here you feel the hand of the director and the editor.<br><br>

Tarantino’s love of film and the movie-goers experience was also illustrated, namely by a handful of scenes. Marvin Shwarz “lights up and pours himself a cognac”, sits down and watches The 14 Fists of McCluskey on 5mm. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) visits the Bruin movie theatre, to watch the film The Wrecking Crew (projected on film) where she stars as Freya Carlson, the ‘klutz’. Later, Rick and Cliff are kicking back at Rick's place with a few beers and some takeaway pizza while they watch the TV show FBI, where Rick makes a guest appearance. It’s the excitement of the movie-going experience that Tarantino captures so beautifully with these scenes. And then, there is the scene of Sharon Tate walking out of the theatre. Around the time of the infamous ‘golden hour’, the sky is a pale grey-blue, and Sharon adorns a smile with the melancholic glee of having just watched a movie.<br><br>

Beyond these observations, the main story of the film was continually stirring in the background and served to anchor each vignette. The film being set in early-February and then later, in early-August of 1969, it follows the events leading up to the brutal murder of Sharon Tate and four others at Roman Polanski’s Hollywood home (Rick is their neighbour in the film). However, instead of these murders taking place in the movie, the members of the Manson cult break into Rick's home and attempt to murder Cliff, Rick and Rick’s wife Francesca (Lorenza Izzo). The ensuing fight between Cliff, Cliff’s dog Brandy, and the Manson family members was brutal. Brandy chomps the intruders to bits while Cliff grabs the ginger character’s head smashes it first into a telephone, then a stone ledge above the fireplace, and finally a desk. This was perhaps the most visceral fight scene I’ve ever seen - you can't help but wince in pain. And to top it all off, the final black-haired member is torched to death by Rick Dalton and his flamethrower from The 14 Fists of McCluskey. This entire sequence harks back to fight scenes in Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and in particular, to the scene in Inglorious Basters when Hitler’s face is pulverised by a sub-machine gun.<br><br>

The film ends with Rick Dalton meeting Jay Sebring (Emile Hirsch) after talking to the police, and is invited up to the house by Sharon Tate. The title “Once Upon A Time In…Hollywood” is displayed and the credits role. As with any Hollywood film, there is always a happy ending, and for Once Upon A Time In…Hollywood, there is no exception. The brutal truth of the murder of Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring is forgotten and everyone leaves the cinema happy.<br><br>

In summary, this Hollywood epic is dense with all of the stuff film-lovers would love. From the corny one-liners to the beautifully choreographed vignettes of the actors ‘acting’, to the move posters, to the fight scenes – this film really has it all. This is Tarantino’s most intellectual film, a very self-aware and metacognitive look at all facets of film: acting, directing, editing, cinematography etc. Possibly an outcast in his filmography, Once Upon A Time In…Hollywood will be remembered for showcasing Tarantino’s love for film and film-goers, and could be seen as a ballad to his beloved medium.
