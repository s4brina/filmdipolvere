                        <br><br><br>

                        I crashed my car today. Long story, but essentially my car wouldn’t start and I was parked at the top of a hill and had the great idea that I would try a rolling start. So, I let off the handbrake, pulled out and rolled down the hill for about 50 metres turning the ignition key intermittently to no avail. By the 50m mark, I had gained considerable speed (I was going about ~30 km/h). The car still wasn’t starting so I decided it was time to pull over and stop. I turned the car left towards the curb and put my foot on the brake... except the brakes wouldn’t work. I stomped on the brakes again... and again... still nothing. Presently, I was heading straight for the back of this parked silver car. I panicked, and not wanting to hit the car in front of me, or continue rolling down the hill onto oncoming traffic, I saw a tree to my left and in a split second decided that I would run into the tree to stop instead. Next thing I knew I hit the tree. I sat there a moment unsure of what exactly just happened, feeling very shocked. A girl who lived in the house near the tree came out shortly after and checked to see what had happened. I gave her the thumbs up and she went back inside. Later, I ended up going to hospital because my neck was hurting so much and I was worried that I may have damaged something. In the end I was cleared of any major damage and had just experienced whiplash. Nothing serious.<br><br>

I had walked to the hospital to go to the emergency department and also walked back and on the way back I was again at the scene of the crash. I stood there looking at it sort of chuckling to myself as to how ridiculous it was that the car was so beaten up and on the footpath and how stupid I was to have attempted something as ridiculous as a rolling start when I had never done one before. Another part of me was distraught at the fact at how much money it would cost me to repair, or possibly money lost because it might have to be written off. Either way, walking past the crashed car was really strange because I didn’t recall exactly what had happened. The memory was still so fresh and I was still in a state of shock. Looking at the mangled car was very surreal, to see it on the footpath and it appeared to me more of an object than triggering any feeling or memory such as flashing back to the moment of impact.<br><br>

The same night I watched the two films selected for this month’s roster, “Ashes”, and “La Jetee”. I sort of remembered that “Ashes” was a kind of experimental montage of images without any concrete narrative and that it had a softness to the aesthetic and the story. I couldn’t actually remember what it was about. The memory was fuzzy, fragmented, barely there and half-grasped. La Jetee was sort of the same. I knew that the premise was that a man has a memory from his childhood and that memory is of a man being shot on the deck of an airport, and that that man was in fact himself. I knew that it’s method of storytelling was a series of still photographs as the next film I am making uses this exact method. “Ashes” and “La Jetee” both ask the question: what is memory? <br><br>

This is a difficult one to answer. I remember things and can feel nostalgic about things and look back on things and remember people’s names and know how certain smells conjure up certain memories and things like that. But memory seems so elusive, so varied, and out of reach. It is so hard to pinpoint exactly what it is.<br><br>

I thought back to what happened today. Even though I have flashing images of me in the car rolling down the hill and trying to brake, and then hitting the tree, and then sitting in the car after the crash, I really have no other impression of what happened to me other than the pain in my neck from the whiplash. Even though that crash happened this morning it seems so distant as to how I am feeling right now writing this. And it made me think about how we remember films, or novels, or music, and how we maybe hum a tune, or remember a certain line in a chapter, a line of poetry, or a scene in a film, and we are taken back to a feeling. A feeling? Is that what it is? We feel things in the present but when we remember something, when it flashes in our mind, we succumb to the feeling of that moment again.<br><br>

“Ashes” was about memory. I took some notes while I watched it as a way to remember because I always seem to forget things in films whenever I watch them. I know some people who know whole scenes, whole pieces of dialogue so clearly, but with me it is never clear, more a faint impression or general feeling when I think about a film. And it makes me think of how everyone’s memory might be different. Sure we remember things like a telephone number, or someone’s name which shows that we remember somewhat equally, but what about the memory of an experience? Something that has duration? Something like a day at the beach, or going to see a live band, or watching a film. And watching “Ashes” I had to take notes to keep up with it, to remember it. I didn’t trust my memory alone to remember what it was about, to remember the images, the themes, the words. And memory in this sense seems so distrustful.<br><br>

I think it was Apichatpong Weerasethakul (the director of "Ashes") that was talking at the end of the film commenting on the images that had come before. The black and white images were of his hometown Khon Kaen and the colour images were of a dream that he had except that his dream was something about his hometown (??) See even now I find it hard to remember the exact words, the exact meaning, and this in itself makes me think of the metaphysics of watching a film. What are we actually doing? Are we watching it to experience what the people on screen are experiencing? Are we experiencing it like we experience a painting where we appreciate the aesthetics and the craft and perhaps its story and what it is trying to convey? Am I analysing these things in the moment? Or are we doing what I’m doing now and writing about my experience and analysing it after the fact? I am doing all those things, it seems, all at once, and much more too, subconsciously I suppose. “Hometown = black and white, dreams = colour” is one of the notes I wrote. What does that mean? Well, at the time I thought that Apichatpong (Joe) was explaining how when his dream faded from colour into black and white he returned to his hometown. But was he even talking about his hometown? Or a dream of his hometown? Again my memory is blurred, and perhaps that was the films intention. “Dreamlike” is how you describe these kinds of films. More a soft impression than a clean stab.<br><br>

“The present must be stripped away.” This is a quote I wrote down while watching La Jetee. The man in the film, the protagonist who undergoes experiments to travel through time, must have his present stripped away in order to journey into the past or future. Because he has such a strong fixation on an image of his past (his own death and an image of a woman on the deck (his one bit of hope)) they choose him as their subject. After some initial success where memories of a peacetime morning, a peacetime bedroom, children, cats, and graves well up, they see promise in him and continue with the experiments. This time he goes back in time and sees the woman in his memory and instantly recognises her. And the narrator says something extremely poignant about their coming together, interacting, just being with one another: they had no recollection of the past, only the “taste of the moment.” <br><br>

So what is memory or remembering but reliving that “taste of the moment”? It’s weird because even though you remember something you forget so many details and minutiae that is just lost, most likely forever, and perhaps only triggered and remembered because of something that happens in the present. So is the present there to serve the triggering of memories? Or is the present there merely to create more memories? Or conversely, is memory there only to give context to the present moment? A history from which you discover which myth you are in. And what about the future and thinking ahead (visualising things), is this the same thing?? It is kind of like memory too. It is blurry, faded, unclear, yet you inhabit feeling. When you think of a lover you dream of what you would do together. You think of a beautiful domestic thing like watching your lover read in the morning light, or laughing together by a river, or kissing in the shade of a large tree. You inhabit these “dreams” and feel them. You are again sort of experiencing them, except that you are never really in direct contact with it like you are in the present. Memory and dreams are like feeling the warmth of a fire at a distance rather than, say, immolating in the fire. Immolation is the present moment, and it is so hot and supercharged with feeling that you hardly have time to process any of it because you are so engulfed in it.<br><br>

So what of this car crash? Well I am left hurt, down some money, and a job to do tomorrow morning re: towing the car. Here I am thinking about the future and making plans for tomorrow. I’ve just had a coffee so I may be up for a little bit longer but this has been a helpful exercise to at least get some thoughts down on the page. This was definitely more reflective than my previous criticisms which read more like essays, but I wanted to explore a more creative, reflective approach after some advice from Felix McNamara. He said something extremely profound which I thought of again as I walked home. He said that “what might be most at stake isn’t necessarily the film itself but something beyond it”, which was with regards to how I should approach my film criticism. I have tried to consider “Ashes” and “La Jetee” as launchpads, touchstones, “triggers” as Felix said, for things that are beyond the film itself. And perhaps reading this reflection triggers some things within you too, good things I hope, things to consider, and things to rid of, just like we do every day when we remember and forget.
