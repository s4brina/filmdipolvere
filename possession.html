                        “Goodness is only a reflection of evil.”
                        <br><br>
                        There is a scene in Possession (1981) where Anna (Isabelle Adjani) is literally channeling the evil spirit from beyond. It is the scene in the U-Bahn tunnel where Anna, having just smashed her bag full of milk into the wall, erupts into a wicked fit. This was the exorcism to end all exorcisms. The birth of the devil himself. Shots of the slime-tentacle-octo-demon in the bedroom (reminiscent of the demon child in “Eraserhead”) of the abandoned Berlin apartment seem to represent something else entirely. While Anna’s delirium in the tunnel was channelling some divine evil, the demon that was in the bedroom represented evil rot. Evil was the name, possession was the game. It was really a simple story with simple dialogue, yet with shocking visuals, such as the scene when Anna raises the electric blade to her neck and cuts herself. It made me think of blood in films and I don’t think I’ve seen a better use of blood than in Possession. Maybe Tarantino’s films come close, but his are much more comical. In Possession, the blood was messy and everywhere, and was such a vibrant colour, it looked real. As a matter of fact, everything was messy. The shots were messy. The dialogue was messy. The acting was messy. But that’s how I like it, and it had the same signature camerawork of Andrzej Zulawski’s unfinished masterpiece “On the Silver Globe" which I absolutely adore. 
                        <br><br>
                        Thinking about it now there were many forms of evil in the film. Adultery, physical abuse, verbal abuse, manipulation, rape, sexual assault, murder, and even child sexual abuse. Evil was the norm. Good was nonexistent. The film kept mentioning evil, and God, and I think it was saying something of God’s mercilessness. Mark didn’t believe in God, he thought He was a ‘disease’. Was this film allegorical in some way? Almost certainly. You could view Anna as the Virgin Mary who falls pregnant with the Devil’s child, Satan, and births him into the world. There is a sequence where Anna is in a church and looks up at Jesus on the cross and begins moaning. I’m not sure what this means, but I think this was the Devil within that was moaning in the face of God’s son, or even the evil twin brother of Jesus, a Satan, calling out from the womb of Anna the Virgin.

                        Going back to that scene in the U-bahn tunnel, Anna’s wild movements and releases of energy was cathartic. It was as though what she was doing was not for her, but for all of us, possessing all evil and letting it course through her body. So evil is everywhere? Is it all around us? Is that we just can’t see it? Or perhaps we are those who choose not to be tempted by it. This path that we’re on, this idea of always spreading the love, the “you got this” generation - is it papering over the cracks? Are we covering up the evils of the world by spreading love for loves sake? Perhaps we should be more realistic here. There is suffering, dare I say more suffering than we can possibly fathom. Everyone is suffering, and there are evil, wicked things out there that are committed, by humans, every day. The news picks up on it, but the news is deflating, so we roll over and put on a TV show or a movie or read a book. We distract ourselves from the evil that surrounds us all, that is right there in front of us. Possession says that there is no Heaven without Hell, there is no good without evil, and there is no light without dark. We must remain on an even keel and Possession pulls the tide towards evil, towards the yin, towards darkness and Hell to remind us that we should be in touch with our Shadow, that we are all capable of evil, that we are all capable of being monsters, that our souls, as Carl Jung pointed out, as much as they reach up to Heaven also reach down to the depths of Hell.

                        There was this repeated moaning from Anna like she was always being fucked or something. Being fucked by the Devil himself. And then, when she is at the ballet school, she channels the Devil and he fucks the little girl who poses. That was the moment of pure evil. Child abuse. But Zulawski doesn’t shy away from this fact. Child abuse is an evil that exists. Rarely do we see art or film discuss subject matters so evil, so dark. Perhaps this was Zulawski’s way of shining a ‘light’ into the darknesses of our world.

                        So in attempting to find another film that Possession reminded me of, I came across the Frtizl case in Austria. I’m sure you would’ve heard about it in some way. Josef Fritzl was the man who locked his daughter Elisabeth in a basement for 24 years. He raped, sexually abused and assaulted Elisabeth and she gave birth to seven of his children, one of which died shortly after birth. Josef Fritzl was arrested in 2008 and was later sentenced to life imprisonment. I mean, that right there just shows you that evil is around. Just when you think everything is all fine and rosy, you come across something like this. Pure, premeditated, carefully orchestrated, evil. Humans are capable of this, and Possession, for all it’s surreal and disturbing imagery, cuts to the core of the very thing thing that humans choose to forget. Evil.

                        We have a choice to make. We have a choice to not fall into temptation, and instead aim for the highest possible good that we can be. That is a choice. But you must always remember and never forget that you are the very same thing that created the Gulag, who orchestrated the Holocaust, and who locked his daughter in a basement for 24 years. You are human and you are capable of evil. Never forget it. 
                        <br><br>
                        Post script. It’s hard to talk about evil. We honestly forget that evil even exists in the world. I’m not saying like it needs more airtime or something, because pretty much every time I open up the BBC app on my phone there is some form of evil that has been done in the world. It’s just difficult to talk about because I have a propensity towards doing good, like most people, who look for the good in their lives and in others and strive to aim for the highest good. Be good. Do the right thing. Treat others how you would like to be treated. Old sayings and cliches but they have lasted this long for a reason. There is something in them that speaks to the very essence of our being. It speaks to the choice we make every day to do good, to act good, to do good things for yourself and others, and to leave the world a better place than it was before. Richer, more vibrant, brighter.

                        I’ve been reading Nick Cave and Sean O’Hagan’s book “Faith, Hope and Carnage”, and here is a quote from Cave that I thought was quite fitting.
                        <br><br>
                        Sean O’Hagan: So do you believe in the redemption in the Christian sense?
                        <br><br>
                        Nick Cave: Well, I think we’re all suffering Sean, and more often than not this suffering is a hell of our own making, it is a state of being for which we are responsible, and I have personally needed to find some kind of deliverance from that. One way I do that is to try to lead a life that has moral and religious value, and to try to look at other people, all people, as if they are valuable. I feel that when I have done something to hurt an individual, say, that the wrong-doing also affects the world at large, or even the cosmic order. I believe that what I have done is an offence to God and should be put right in some way. I also believe our positive individual actions, our small acts of kindness, reverberate through the world in ways we will never know. I guess what I am say is - we mean something. Our actions mean something. We are of value.
                        <br><br>
                        This is a quote coming from a man who’s son died after falling off a cliff. He was 15. I think if anyone is in touch with the wickedness, the cruelty, the sheer mercilessness of God and the forces of evil and the place of Hell, Cave would be that person. And Cave, here, ultimately chooses to do good. For him there is no other choice. A world of bitterness, hatred, cynicism, and resentment is not rectitude for him. His relationship to God matters. He views God as the ultimate judge, and he strives to aim high and live a good life. He has come from a dark place and must find the light. His album “Ghosteen” is in many ways his absolution, and in his own words, his way of making sense of all the pain and suffering.
