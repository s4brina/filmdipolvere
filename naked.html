Well what can I say about Naked (1993)? Johnny seems to fuck a lot. Sex seems to come to him as naturally as anything. He is all for ‘the moment’, never the future, and hardly the past. He muses a lot, and his musings were relevant, microcosmic, aphoristic, elucidating, philosophical, all with Mancunian wit. His outlook on life is that everything is fucked, that the whole world is fucked, and that we are all doomed, so we all may as well just fuck. Right? Who can disagree with sex? It was really a dire movie now that I think about it. It didn’t instil in me any hope or betterment having watched it. More of the same, really. More of the same day to day suffering, and with every day inching ever closer to death. What did Johnny say about books? Some things no matter how much you read, we will never understand. I like Johnny, and as bleak as his outlook on life is, he seems to enjoy himself and make the most of his time being alive. I think at one point he says that humans will eventually die out just like the dinosaurs and that all will be forgotten and man will cease to exist - his every mode of being, his every utterance seems to be in the knowledge that this is a fact and that the end is inevitable. So then, what do you do with your life with this in mind? Well you have jolly good fun all the time like Johnny does. Go from couch to couch, eating other people’s food, pinching other people’s cigarettes, never sleep, always someone new to talk with, always a place to read, always a place to go, a place to sleep, a place to shower. Always someone to fuck.<br><br>

It’s easy to go down this path, and Johnny seems all too happy to continue along. He has come to the conclusion that if he suffers then other people should suffer too, that they should suffer for him not with him. Other people are merely in service of his desires, his needs, his wants. He doesn’t build relationships, he doesn’t seem to care about anyone or anything. He has no home, has no family, no pets, not even a proper friend. He has no future, and doesn’t want one. He doesn’t know where he’s going and doesn’t care. Life is a game to him. Everything is there for play, to be toyed with, laughed over, take the piss out of. So is that what Naked is saying? Life is a game? Just another cliche as Johnny would say. I think everything about this film paradoxically, leads to another cliche, the very thing Johnny despises. So that’s it then? There’s no point in discussing anything? There’s no point in me even writing this reflection. Where does it lead anyway? Why not become a nurse or an aid worker or someone who cares for the sick? That seems to be a nobler cause. They always seem to need aid workers. So why don’t more people do it? Why doesn’t everybody just help each other out? Why is there evil in the world? Because God is wicked Johnny says, and he thinks humans are just for His entertainment. Maybe we are who knows. But we’ll keep ambling along, just like Johnny does at the very end of the film; hobbling, limping, beaten and bruised having had the shit kicked out of us. We are barely alive and just holding it together, as we walk down the road, inching ever closer to our inevitable death. <br><br>

Short postscript. I was thinking about something Johnny said about how in the future humans will be rendered useless, our bodies that is, and consciousness will be encapsulated in some immaterial form. With the introduction of AI and the curve of technological innovation, I don’t see how this can’t be an inevitability. Perhaps humans will become cyborg in ways that we do not yet understand. I don’t think humans will become extinct because of technology, but I can envision a slow degradation of humanist qualities like emotions and feelings, things which get in the way of logic and reason, and the slow rise of assimilation with the bent of technology. Perhaps everything in the future will be AI assisted in some way and things which were once ‘handmade’ will become relics of an ancient past. We are creating more than ever and I wonder how much of it will last, how much of it will be preserved, and how any of it can stand the test of time. History tells us that much will be lost, forgotten, burned and returned to dust. But what of our digital world? Can that be buried beneath the Earth? It is cast in stone is it not? I suppose all of history is available, in some shape or form, on the internet, and physical artworks are preserved by our institutions, museums and galleries. But who curates the digital landscape? Who says “this is an important digital work and it must be preserved”? Does the digital world really have any value whatsoever? Is it merely a lesser version of our corporeal world, our world of smell and taste? Will it ever surpass our corporeal world as the dominant ‘reality’? Or will it become a second reality with which we increasingly interact with as we bounce between ‘real’ life and ‘virtual’ life. And if the internet is like a collective memory (or a collective dream), what about something like the personality of a human? Could that ever be encoded and preserved? Or are their some things that will be forgotten, lost forever, like tears in rain?
