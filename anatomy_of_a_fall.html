                      I hate that I have to read it. Not because I want to, but because I have to. Nietzsche, Freud, Jung, Dostoyevsky; Proust, Dickens, Joyce, Ulysses; Eliot, Yeats, Shakespeare, Blake; Dante, Machiavelli, Goethe, Faust; Walter Benjamin, Adorno, Barthes, Kant; Homer, Plato, Socrates, Sappho; reading these authors is like a rite of passage. In order to be a serious academic, you must read most if not all of these author’s otherwise remain a dilettante. I’ve always thought that reading these authors meant you were playing with the ‘big boys’ and that every esteemed artist has read all of these authors, or is at least aware of the essence of their work. The only author that I have somewhat of a grasp on is Carl Jung. In this respect, I still feel like an outsider. Presently, I am the dilettante. I read short passages of the works of these authors from time to time, yet never invest in a proper interrogation of their work. Usually, this is because I fail to connect with their work or consider certain concepts too abstract or too difficult to understand and so I drop the book and the author too. This might have to do with a metaphysical weight I feel when I read, or even consider reading works by these authors. They seem heavy and dense and require a lot of time and energy and focus which makes them all the more daunting. One thing I admire about these authors is how they consistently achieve a deepness to their work while also achieving breadth. I would like my criticism to be deeper. Presently, it is not very deep. Even though it may touch on deep subjects, there still remains a shallowness to it. Perhaps this perceived shallowness is best summarised by how little time I spend on each piece of criticism, which only ranges from 1 to 3 days. I have in my mind this idea that the greatest works of the above authors took years to write and that profound and illuminating work can only be achieved purely through spending a lot of time on something. A Chinese parable, which Italo Calvino retells in his short novel Six Memos for the Next Millennium, hints that this belief may be misleading: Among Chuang-tzu's many skills, he was an expert draftsman. The king asked him to draw a crab. Chuang-tzu replied that he needed five years, a country house, and twelve servants. Five years later the drawing was still not begun. "I need another five years," said Chuang-tzu. The king granted them. At the end of these ten years, Chuang-tzu took up his brush and, in an instant, with a single stroke, he drew a crab, the most perfect crab ever seen. Time creates a certain posture to a work. If a work took 5 seconds to make, then we will aptly view it as something like a sketch; quick, fast, and instinctual. If a work of art took 5 years then we will aptly view it as something that took a lot of time, thought, energy, precision and patience to make. Time spent on something not only alters the finished product, but alters how that product is viewed. I don’t know where I’m going with this exactly. I was writing all of this as a preface to my critique of the towering achievement, Anatomy of a Fall, which won the Palme d’Or this year (2023). Film is very different to literature. Concepts in literature can be hard to understand as authors have the luxury to be very abstract and poetic, and syntax (and vocabulary) can also prove to be a barrier. Film seems to present things as they are, where there is no one clear definition or meaning or interpretation. Although literature may do that too, it is more certain of its meaning. Film is strange because it occupies a sort of middle-ground between art, literature and music; it is like art because it is a visual medium, it is like literature because it tells us a story, and it is like music because, well, music generally accompanies and imbues the former two with meaning. It is a blend of these different spheres, and certain films seem to lean into one or two of them more than the others. Anatomy of a Fall practically begins with a song. A snippet of a sample from the song P.I.M.P. by 50 cent blares down through the chalet from upstairs while Sandra, a writer, is being interview by a journalist. Her interview is clearly disrupted by the music, which was intentionally put on by Samuel (her husband) and asks the journalist if they would like to visit another time, or meet in Grenoble. This song essentially becomes the film’s theme as it is replayed over and over. The song in its first playing was gentile and playful and had great comic effect, where Sandra sort of laughs at the absurdity of the situation with the journalist. Its next playing is in the courtroom where Sandra is being investigated for the alleged murder of her husband. Here, the song takes on a completely different meaning. It is suddenly filled with irony and satire and becomes very abrasive in how playful it sounds in the serious environment of the courtroom. Here, music takes centre stage and becomes a focal point, a pivot of the film. The song becomes almost like a bad memory, and becomes more and more abrasive as the movie continues. I really need to watch this film again because it is hard for me to really remember much of it. I just remembered that it was an ‘emotional rollercoaster’. Is that the best I can muster? Is that seriously the best I can do when describing this film? Maybe I do need to watch it a second time. I think I will. Watch this space.
