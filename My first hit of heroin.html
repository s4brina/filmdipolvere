                        I think Heaven Knows What, right now, is my favourite movie of all time. Why? It was depraved. Heaven Knows What was a portrait of the depraved. The lost and forgotten world that we see in our cities. Drug addicts, the homeless, crackheads as we call them in Australia. A derogatory word really and one that effaces the humanness of these people and treats them as second-rate. <br><br>

                        The film is based on the memoir of the lead actress Arielle Homes who was encouraged to write the memoir after meeting Josh Safdie. In many respects this film is a documentary of her life. However fictional the premise of the film might be, it showed no signs that this was fiction. This was real, this was happening. There on screen is Arielle Homes actually shooting up. That wasn’t acting. That was real.<br><br>

                        I’ve been putting off writing this critique because what was there to critique? My mind kept returning to the characters in the film and I reminded myself when things weren’t going as well as they could have, that life isn’t as tough as Harley and Iliya and Michael’s is. It was like they were a new baseline, a new low that I experienced myself and one that I hold dear. It was as though I entered their world and lived in that world for a time and came out the other end a new person. It isn’t farfetched to say that I was changed by my experience of watching Heaven Knows What. It seriously shifted my perspective on life, particularly those that look less fortunate and look like they are under the influence of drugs or look like they are struggling. The story was relatable maybe because the characters were in New York, a city, and I live in the city and I see characters just like Harley and Iliya and Michael on the streets. Maybe for this reason it resonated so strongly with me. A film about poverty in a developing country might have had a similar impact, in terms of forming a new baseline from which you can feel grateful for all of the things you have in your privileged, Western life, yet it would hit different, it would be a different feeling entirely. I don’t know but Heaven Knows What affected me like not many films have, and it has opened my eyes to the humanity that can be found in even the most depraved situations, in the most depraved circumstances. “People are valuable” as Nick Cave points out, and one can easily forget that these druggos, these crackheads are humans like the rest of us. We forget this most of the time.

                        OK I’ve come back to finish this goddamn review or critique or whatever it is (it’s been 3 weeks since the above was written). Meta statement. Is this really helping anyone? Probably not, but if you are reading this I hope you’re enjoying hearing me ramble on about all this films I’ve been watching. Making films and writing these critiques keeps me going. It’s something to do I guess.
                        <br><br>

                        There’s one thing that I wanted to say about Heaven Knows What that has been on my mind these past few weeks. The films that I watched since watching Heaven Knows What (or attempted to watch (I stopped watching a few for reasons I will now explain)) pale in comparison to the stark realism and visceral intensity of HKW to the point where every film that I have seen since has seemed “soft” or too “delicate” or too “cute” for it to really connect with me. It’s almost as if Heaven Knows What was my first hit of heroin and that there is no going back now. Having had a taste of that feeling, everything seems totally subpar for it to really have any sort of impact. I want that heroin again. I want to see the fucked up and depraved lives of people. I want to see the dark corners that many films do not dare to venture to. I realised that Heaven Knows What is the kind of movie that I like and is the kind of movie that has in the past had the most impact on me. I began thinking about other ‘docufiction’ or reality-in-motion type films I have seen that have been very impactful. I think of Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark, or Abbas Kiarostami’s Close-Up or Chris Marker’s Sans Soleil or La Jetee. And even films that were obviously fiction, their aesthetic or story was realist or neo-realist, films like Once Upon a Time in America, Synecdoche, New York, Blue is the Warmest Colour, or any of the Safdie brother’s films. Of course there are exceptions, but these are the kind of films that have impacted me most and to be honest are the kind of films I would like to make myself.
                        <br><br>

                        Going back to Heaven Knows What, I really crave another hit like that and I’m sure there are many films out there that do that. (Please write in if you have any recommendations.) Perhaps there are even books that are like that to? I’m not sure. I’m trying to read more and at the moment Nick Cave and Sean O’Hagan’s book Faith Hope and Carnage has been extremely grounding, guiding, and elucidating. It’s a great read and very accessible and I highly recommend picking it up if you have the cash. That book too is quite documentarian and is about real people and real troubles and real-life so to speak. It speaks to the heart of our experiences as humans. It seems like I don’t care about nuances anymore, and perhaps that is a product of our times. We crave novelty and extremes. These days we are all making content, we are all doing our bit of creative action, we are all commenting, writing in, making TikTok videos. It’s unrelenting, and it takes something really impactful to cut through all of this and connect with people. Heaven Knows What certainly connected with me and I recommend watching it if you feel like a hit.
