                    <h1>Art Film?</h1>
                    <p class="date">Jack Fairman</p>
                    <br><br><br>

                    <p class="article"> David Foster Wallace, in his book “A supposedly fun thing I’ll never do again”,
                        says that the point of an art film is generally intellectual or aesthetic and tries to “wake the
                        audience up.” The aim of a commercial film, on the other hand, is to “entertain”, and in some
                        ways allows the audience to fantasise about a more compelling and more attractive and more
                        entertaining life than theirs and renders the audience into a comfortable lull. What DFW was
                        explaining was how David Lynch’s films occupy this sort of middle-ground between art film and
                        commercial film. Now, it wouldn’t be fair to compare a Hong Kong action film like Police Story
                        3: Supercop to a Lynch film. However, like Lynch’s films, Supercop seems to occupy this
                        middle-ground between art and commercial. How? <br><br><br>

                        It’s not by any stretch an art film; it doesn’t provoke any soul-searching or ask you to think
                        deeply or do work. It is certainly as far away as being considered an art film as you could get.
                        But a commercial film? Could it be that it does have some commercial-film-tropes about it?
                        Certainly, it “entertains”. And I suppose that in its essence that was its goal. However, there
                        is something about the action sequences in the film, particularly the stunt work, which really
                        sets Supercop apart from other “action” films. Quentin Tarantino once said that Supercop
                        features some of the “greatest stunts ever filmed in any movie ever”, and when pressed on which
                        movie scene he would save for the last of humanity to see, he said the final scene of Supercop.
                        For Tarantino (who is obviously a big fan of the Hong Kong action film genre and is across
                        probably all of Hong Kong cinema) to heap so much praise onto this film certainly warrants a
                        closer inspection into what makes Supercop so special.<br><br><br>

                        What I think immediately sets Supercop apart from other films is how the actors put themselves
                        in danger. There are situations tht are not sort-of, or kinda or a-little-bit -dangerous, but
                        seriously dangerous, and at times 100% life-threatening. The two scenes that remain with me (and
                        are the scenes that Tarantino refers to) is firstly the scene where Jackie Chan hangs off a
                        rope-ladder, which is itself hanging off a helicopter, which is itself going full-pelt twisting
                        and turning through the skyline of Hong Kong. And there you see captured on film Jackie Chan
                        holding on for dear life with no support, no rope attached to him, no harness, no nothing,
                        flying through the air. Fast forward a few moments later and Jackie Chan is fighting enemies on
                        top of a moving train which is travelling at considerable pace, and the actors are up there
                        fighting, jumping between carriages, getting thrown (I think some even get thrown off the
                        train), and all done without any safety equipment (there’s even a moment where Jackie Chan falls
                        down between two carriages and lands on the couplings). When the credits start rolling there
                        begins a montage of outtakes from the film and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the
                        film (common for Jackie Chan films). There’s the usual sort of gag-reel bloopers and
                        uncontrollable laughter, but one telling part of this montage was an outtake of the scene where
                        Michelle Yeoh attempts to jump from a moving van onto a convertible and falls off onto the road.
                        You then see a rush of people scrambling towards her to check to see if she is OK.<br><br><br>

                        The closest comparison I can draw between what J.C. and M.Y. did in Supercop is what Alex
                        Honnold does on his free-soloing climbs. Honnold didn’t just climb the most difficult rock face
                        you can ever climb (El Capitan in Yosemite National Park) on a whim. He had been thinking about
                        it for many years and prepared for months so that he was in the right frame of mind before he
                        surmounted his greatest-ever climb. You could also draw comparisons with what acrobats or
                        trapeze artists do during a show of a travelling circus: flips, spins, jumps people being
                        thrown, flying, then being caught, with nothing but cold-hard-ground beneath them. But they too
                        would have invested thousands of hours of practice, most likely with many safety precautions
                        before the performers even remotely feel comfortable to perform on stage. It may seem farfetched
                        to make these comparisons because what Alex Honnold does and what circus performers do on the
                        surface seems a lot more dangerous than what Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh did. But what I think
                        shouldn’t be underestimated is that J.C. and M.Y. didn’t have all the time in the world to
                        prepare for these dangerous stunts. I’m sure they deliberated extensively on the exact moves
                        etc. visualising it and walking through it many times. And their experience doing stunts in
                        other films would have helped. But this was a movie, and in the movie business (particularly
                        with low-budget action film like Supercop) there is the constant tick of the clock and I am
                        convinced that J.C. and M.Y. were undoubtedly under the pressure of a tight budget and tight
                        schedule and didn’t have all week, all month or even all year to prepare and wait for when the
                        time was right. They were seriously going into these stunts without any practice, without any
                        safety equipment, essentially going into them totally blind. And what we see on screen are some
                        of the most dangerous, most daring, and most entertaining action sequences ever caught on
                        film.<br><br><br>

                        Going back to DFW’s ideas on art films and commercial films: I think Supercop does land in that
                        in-between area. What is artful? The action sequences, which are noticeably spikier than the
                        action sequences you see today which are so clean-cut and to-a-tee that there is little left to
                        the imagination. On first viewing you could easily view Supercop as a commercial film; it
                        certainly ticks all the boxes re: entertainment. But as aforementioned, it isn’t a part of that
                        group of commercial films that renders you into a doze, which use the same platitudes and tropes
                        and gimmicks that hit the right spots and say what you want to hear, and most glaringly (and far
                        too often) always throw in a super-cringey attempt at humour. So no, Supercop isn’t like other
                        commercial films, or even like other action genre films. It is really a blend of what makes an
                        art film compelling and what makes commercial films so entertaining, and heaps on a bit of
                        something extra which gives it its own unique special flavour (like the cuisine of Hong
                        Kong).<br><br><br>

                        Supercop seems like a movie that would fly under the radar even though I’m sure many people went
                        to see it in cinemas when it was released in 1992. I personally hadn’t heard of it before and
                        didn’t know that Tarantino loved it so much. I didn’t even know what it was about before I
                        watched it at GOMA. But I’m certainly glad that I went and saw it because it was so entertaining
                        and so funny and the stunts – my god the stunts! – were just out of this world.<br><br><br>
