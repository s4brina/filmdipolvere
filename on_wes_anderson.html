                        Whenever I think of Wes Anderson, I think of the word ‘style’. Anderson has a very particular style that he achieves through a combination of camerawork (shot composition, framing, symmetry, 360 degree swivels), props (trinkets, knick knacks, unique product design, food, food packaging), acting (deadpan), writing (quirky, domestic, surreal), aesthetics (desaturated colour palettes, unique one-of-a-kind clothes) etc. etc. These are some of the things that make up Anderson’s style (which has inadvertently become somewhat of an AI meme online). His productions are like a Swiss-watch. The finest craftsmanship, the finest quality, the finest ‘engineering’. Everything is bound up so tight and tightly wound. Every little piece is a mechanism for the smooth clockwork of his ‘style’, and everything, absolutely everything, is in service of this style. To some extent, I think his work suffers from this fixation.

<br><br>
I’m writing this short preface before I watch Asteroid City because there is a myth about Wes Anderson that I have present in my mind. He is a great director, a great artist, one of the most important filmmakers of our generation. And yet I feel emptiness whenever I think of his films. Beautiful as they are, that is all they are. Easy on the eye. To borrow a phrase from my friend Brayden Keynes, “his films are always a 7/10.” You never hate them, nor do they hold a dear place in your heart. They never flop nor do they get me excited. Again, they impress me for their sheer craftsmanship, but it is like enjoying a painting only because of its craftsmanship. Art should challenge, and his films never seem to test my convictions or conjure up strong emotions. Am I asking too much?
<br><br>
I know nothing about Wes Anderson. I’ve never watched an interview with him and have briefly seen his face flash up on screen during the Golden Globes one time. He seems to be this peripheral figure, this silent introvert that has his beautiful little worlds in his mind that he shares with the world every few years. I don’t know why but this bugs me. It’s like a hipster projecting his Birkenstock and socks lifestyle at you saying “look how cool I look” or “look at this cool thing I’m doing now”, and it is also the way he talks, not exactly what he actually talks about, but the way he goes about things that irks you. He never seems to work with his actors. They always seem to be doing work for him, and for some reason I dislike this approach.
<br><br>
I don’t know but I’m not really looking forward to Asteroid City. I’m scared it’s going to be another soulless Anderson film that cares more about aesthetics than it does substance. I’m going in rather pessimistically and critically. By now I’d hoped Anderson would have delivered a masterpiece, a seminal work that I look forward to watching. And if The Grand Budapest Hotel is that seminal work, then maybe I’ve missed the boat and the ship has sailed, or I’m just completely missing something. Perhaps now he is past it? To borrow a quote from his American contemporary, Tarantino says, “A boxer has his time in the ring, and then his time is up.” Is Anderson’s time up? Will he become like a Woody Allen and produce a film every two years, churning out the same old thing time and again? Will Asteroid City be any different to his previous work? One review on Letterboxd says this: “…by far the director’s best effort since “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” and in some respects the most poignant thing he’s ever made — boasts all of his usual hallmarks and then some.” After reading this I am all of a sudden hopeful. At the very least I get to see Sophia Lillis, and I absolutely adore her.

The above text is going to be the first part of an exquisite corpse and will act as a preface to my impressions after the film. Here goes nothing.
<br><br>
Well, I’m back. Maybe I’ve been a too harsh on Anderson. Maybe I misremembered how fun and entertaining his films can be. Maybe Asteroid City is his best film ever. There’s a lot to unpack so I’m going to look at my notes and see where we can begin. (Note I’ve just changed the above text to white so I can’t see it or read it. I forgot that even with a self-imposed exquisite corpse I shouldn’t read the material before. I did however read the last line, which is fine I suppose.)
<br><br>

Anderson surprised me. I didn’t expect to be blown away by a film of his (as you can tell from the above), but I was. Asteroid City is a play within a play. A commentary on a play and the actual playing out of the play. It was a little bit complicated, but I liked how he switched between the black and white ‘real’ world, and the subdued colours of Asteroid City. The film begins with the introduction of Augustine, his teenager son Woodrow, and his three daughters. They are there for Asteroid Day, a day to commemorate the impact of an Asteroid some 3 odd thousand years ago. They are also there for Woodrow “Brainiac” to collect a prize for his invention, a light projection on the moon. That is where I’ll leave it for a recap on the story, for now at least. 
<br><br>

From the very first moment you are again introduced to the signature camerawork of a Wes Anderson film. Each scene (which tellingly is also numbered on the title card before each sequence of scenes) is like a talking painting. Something like an animated Hopper painting. The way he puts people in the frames, off-centre, on the left or right, in the corner, dead centre, keeps your eyes moving from side to side, up and down. An example of a shot sequence in the film: dolly out, track left, pan left, stop, pan right, stop, dolly in, cut. Everything was so synchronised, so intricate, so well-crafted, it was seriously like watching clockwork. I enjoyed this aspect of the film, and it kept me intrigued.
 <br><br>

 All of his chracters speak without emotion. They are quote unquote ‘deadpan’. It honestly made me laugh at some scenes who’s punchline was more a formality than anything forced. I thought that Anderson didn’t tackle tough existential questions, and yet his characters, although emotionally mute, talked of the pain they were in: “I don’t like the way the alien looked at us. He looked at us as if we were doomed” said Augustine, to which Midge replies, “Maybe we are.” or when Augustine calls out to Midge who is laying in the bathtub; Midge lay dead still, with pills on the floor, and you think she has just committed suicide. I’ve never remembered an Anderson film that grapples with pain like he did in Asteroid City, and to my surprise he delivered something quite deep. These moments were punctuations in an otherwise colourless myriad of minimalist (?) facial expressions, yet it worked. Very rarely did a character show signs of vulnerability, and this was perhaps most evident when Midge Campbell says to Augistine “We don’t share the depths of our pain. That’s our connection.” None of Anderson’s characters showed signs of pain, or suffering, or anything emotional. Even after being told that his mother had died, Woodrow seemed (unsurprisingly) unfazed, however briefly solemn and despondent. Suffering is a given, and Anderson chooses not to make a point of it. Instead, he asks us to escape our day to day lives, our troubles, our worries, our office jobs, and to enter into his world, just for a short while, before we go back to the humdrum of life. I entered, pessimistically I might add, and left glad that I bought a ticket.

 Note: That font! What is that font!? The signature typography of his films was there, again! I wonder who he hires to do his typography? Or is it him? Auteur I guess, right?
