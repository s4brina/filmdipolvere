                     Watching Robert Smithson’s film Spiral Jetty (1970) you get a sense of the concept of ‘entropy’ - that everything in the universe is slowly breaking down. For long periods, you watch the construction of the land-art that is the “Spiral Jetty”, located at a point along the shore of the Great Salt Lake, Utah. You see heavy machinery moving mounds of rocks and dirt, with loud, destructive crashes which is interspersed with tranquil shots of the Great Salt Lake water lapping against a rock or the shore. As you watch you then begin to consider “time”. It is as though the water that laps against the rocks has seen it all, from the beginning of time, to the dinosaurs, to now. Then you see the destruction of man, carving up the Earth, assembling it, reconfiguring it, moving it, placing it. Why? To make sense of it. To make sense of time. To make sense of our place on the Earth. Perhaps that is why we carve up the Earth and create monuments, and this is perhaps why Robert Smithson made the Spiral Jetty, a monument to “forget the future” and to try and make sense of our existence on the Earth. For Earth on its own is chaos, and there is no logic or reason in chaos, merely confusion and disrepair. We must make things become clear, through some sort of language, which can be interpreted and communicated, and for this reason we must create things which can be interpreted in some shape or form, which will ultimately bring order to the chaos. This is in many respects the role of art. Is Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty a work of art? I remember when I saw an exhibition of Smithson’s work at The University of Queensland, Smithson touched on the idea of the context of art, and the role of the art gallery. I don’t remember exactly what he said, but he said that the context which art is presented is important, and by Smithson’s definition it would be safe to say that the Spiral Jetty is definitely a work of art, for it communicates something to people on a deep level. It is trying to say something. About time, about the Earth, about entropy. The spiral has no beginning and no end. It forges onwards, spinning, turning, rotating, for infinity, until the end of time. “Rocks, mud, crystals, water” Smithson repeats for every point on the compass. It is the same thing over and over. The same description, the same materials, the same observation - it’s like he’s asking us to consider the makeup of our environment, the infinitude of things which are in our field of view, from the tinniest spec, to the largest mountain, how everything is part and whole and there is no clear definition to tell this from that, this rock, which belongs to this shore, which touches this ocean. It all bleeds into one another. And this Earth that we harvest, move, destroy, carve up, is the same Earth that the dinosaurs walked on. The very same Earth. And yet we forget this fact.

                    The Earth’s surface layer is impermanent. Over thousands of years the top layer will then become subterranean and a new layer will form on top. Spiral Jetty’s longevity is subject to erosion, and who’s lifespan will perhaps be measured in hundreds of years. But what about the film? There is a permanence to film because it preserves things. That is it’s beauty. A film is a record, an artefact, and in this case, Spiral Jetty [Film] (1970) is an artefact of an artefact. The film itself is a work of art documenting a work of art. I don’t know what Smithson’s intention with this film was, whether it was more artefact or more artwork, but I sense it was more artefact. It serves as a document that accompanies the mythology of the Spiral Jetty and shows its transformation from raw Earth into the famous spiral.

                    Gary Shapiro, on the Hold/Smithson Foundation makes an interesting observation:
                    <br><br>

                    “Smithson's insistence on the significance of entropy and his early accidental death (1973) left open a number of questions concerning the work's maintenance and preservation. They can be condensed to this: to what extent should a work that is meant to exhibit the entropic character of both nature and culture be conserved in its original state?”
                    <br><br>

                    It is a fascinating question, because on the one hand you would like to preserve the work for it’s cultural and artistic importance. In many ways it is a masterwork and the seminal work of Smithson’s ideas on entropy. Yet the preservation and upkeep of the work would go against the very thing with which it is trying to represent. Personally, I think it should be left to entropic ruin, as I’m sure Smithson would want it to. He had intentions to build up the Jetty even more so it could sit above sea level, but this never materialised. So perhaps this is where the film comes in. Even after the Jetty has disintegrated and eroded, there will still be, captured on film, the light of the day the Spiral Jetty came to be.
                    <br><br>

                    I like the idea of ‘film’ being a document more so than simply a medium. It’s utility to document is unlike any other medium, bar photography which too documents things. Shapiro notes that Smithson admired Chris Marker’s film “La Jetee”, which in many respects might have actually inspired the Spiral Jetty. La Jetee is a series of still photographs, documenting a man’s travel to the past and the future. This method of storytelling speaks to film’s utility as a medium of documentation. A photograph, like a film, is forever, and is not subject to entropic decay. Why would Smithson choose to make a film about the Spiral Jetty? Why not just take photographs and write an accompanying essay? I think it’s because although a film can serve the purpose to document, it also by nature tells a story. In the Jetty’s case, it shows the raw, untouched Earth turned over into mounds of rocks and mud, and then finally carefully placed to form the spiral. 
                    <br><br>

                    At the end of the film, Smithson is seen traversing the spiral. It’s as though he is searching for something. He runs with a sense of expectation as though expecting some magical discovery. And finally, when he reaches the end of the spiral, he is instead met with a precipice: eternity. And there, at the end of the Spiral Jetty, Smithson, and us the viewer, stare into the abyss of eternity, watching the work of entropic decay that continues outward forever, for all time.
