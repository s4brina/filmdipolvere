                        Stalker (1979) is a film directed by Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky starring Alexander Kaidanovsky (the Stalker), Anatoly Solonitsyn (the Writer), Nikolai Gink (the Professor), and Alisa Freindlich (the Stalker’s wife). The screenplay was written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, and is loosely based on their 1972 novel “Roadside Picnic”. Tarkovsky, Solonitsyn and Tarkovsky’s wife Larisa Tarkovskaya would later die because of complications allegedly caused by the toxic chemicals that they were exposed to during filming.<br><br>

                        Stalker is no ordinary film; it belies any formal catergorisaton. You could attempt to describe it as a serious intellectual film about the human condition. It commands your full attention without any distractions. What is Stalker about? Here is an excerpt from an essay generated by ChatGPT:<br><br>
                        
                        “At its core, Stalker is a meditation on the human quest for meaning, and it grapples with some of the most fundamental questions of the human condition. The protagonist, the Stalker, is a guide who takes people into the mysterious and dangerous Zone, a place where wishes are rumoured to come true. This journey into the unknown serves as a powerful metaphor for the search for meaning and fulfillment, and it forces us to confront the essential ambiguity of existence.”<br><br>
                        
                        Yes, the quest for meaning, yes, the human condition, yes, the mystery of life. I don’t want to be too critical here, but these are hallmarks evident in most films of this ilk i.e. films by masters particularly from this era. Don’t get me wrong, the questions that are posed by the film are its everlasting impression. However, I don’t want to focus on these questions. What I noticed while watching Stalker was something that was beyond the story, latent in the background if you will, that was more than just a canvas for the monologues and dialogues. It was a very unique aesthetic of how the story was told. How was Stalker’s storytelling unique?<br><br> 
                        
                        I think in a broad sense you could describe the film as feeling ‘real’ or ‘natural’ or as close to real-life as possible. This realism might have been generated by the atmosphere in general i.e. the atmosphere on set and the atmosphere that we see onscreen, which is part Tarkovsky’s direction, and part the desolate wasteland the actors are in. This atmosphere is palpable, so much so that you cannot believe that you are watching the actors navigate this drug-paraphernalia-ridden wasteland for a "film". I think unlike many films, and many directors for that matter, Stalker and Tarkovsky achieved the unachievable in cinema: for everything to come from a person's inner being. Now, not all films provoke actors to channel  or encounter their inner being, nor do many ask the actors to consider their kismet during filming, and even more rarely for this to be captured on film (an example I can think of is Martin Sheen's bloodied breakdown in Apocalypse Now). Rarely, but most certainly in great films, you forget you are even watching a film, or forget the premise that you are watching actors ‘act’. And with Stalker, this usual pretense of film-watching isn't there. What you see is the human condition opened like a wound. You feel its latent heat like the radiation coming off raw plutonium. It is all laid to bare. <br><br>
                        
                        Variations of this 'truth' cinema has become more in-vogue of late and is really the frontrunner in terms of aesthetic direction in many art films/non-commercial films (take Nomadland (2017) for example). These films use the language of a 'documentary’ - unchoreographed, unscripted, nonstaged, found-footage etc. They invite you to view the film as reality-in-motion. The overall effect gives you the impression that these people onscreen are not actors, they aren’t even non-actors, they are simply human beings.<br><br>
                        
                        One of the most memorable moments in Stalker was this sequence where the three protagonists are taking a rest by a creek after having navigated a decent amount of the Zone and have grown tired. The camera (close-up to the actors faces) focuses on each of them, and each of them looks directly into the camera, without speaking or moving, with an expression which is both mute and alive, as if to say, “here I am”, “are you watching this?”, or even more provocatively “what do you make of all this?”<br><br>
                        
                        With this in mind, Stalker goes beyond any conventional ways of analysing a film, because this wasn’t a ‘film’ in a canonical fictional sense. I thought of it more a documentary. But 'documentary'? It isn't that either. The footage captured could objectively be described as a journey of three men who meander through a toxic, sulphur-laced wasteland, and would later die because of complications arising from their exposure to this toxic wasteland. I honestly don’t know what to call that. And as much as it is a 'film' by definition, the word ‘film’ doesn’t seem right (Stalker can’t be analysed with the same analytical lens you would cast over a David Lynch film for example). Stalker isn’t a pure fiction, nor is it a documentary, nor is it even a docufiction. Those people, cast and crew, were out there, exploring these toxic marshes, risking their lives in the name of art. I mean, where, when, how do we draw the line between fiction and non-fiction? And w/w/h do we draw the line between merely a 'film' and a _________?’
